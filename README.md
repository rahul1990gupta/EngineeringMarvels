This project stands on the shoulder of giants. Some of the common household items are so complex that without these people, I wouldn't have been able to understand the concept itself. I am grateful for the tireless content creators who make it possible for rest of us to understand these things and learn something from them. Where useful, I have also taken a screenshot from the video to make a concept easier to understand for the reader. I don not claim ownership of any visuals used in this project. If you don't your content to be used, let me know.
